        <h3>Genealogy (Shajra-e-Nasab)</h3>
        <p>
          Your respected father was Faiz Ahmed Baig, his father was Ahmed Baig,
          and his grandfather was Miyan Roshan Ahmed Baig. Your father, Faiz
          Ahmed Baig, belonged to the city of Buland Mohalla, Tuntan, India. He
          was among the close disciples (murideen-e-khaas) of Hazrat Tajuddin
          Nagpuri (RA). He received spiritual blessings (roohani faiz) from
          Hazrat Tajuddin and completed his spiritual journey under Hazrat Baba
          Tajuddin Auliya of Nagpur, attaining a high rank in spirituality. He
          never revealed himself publicly and spent his entire life in obedience
          to Allah, embracing a life of faqr (spiritual poverty). Faiz Ahmed
          Baig also received spiritual blessings from another saint, known as
          Hafiz Na Beena . Under Hafiz Sahib’s supervision, Faiz Ahmed Baig
          completed a spiritual retreat (chilla) on Surah Quraysh. Hafiz Na
          Beena was a renowned spiritual healer (aamil) of his time. Such was
          his fame that when someone in the village was possessed by jinn, it
          would suffice to whisper in the ear of the afflicted, “Hafiz Na Beena
          sends his greetings,” and the jinn would flee instantly. Roshan Ahmed
          Baig had two brothers: one was Miyan Dorhay Ahmed Baig, and the other
          was Miyan Kaday Ahmed Baig. Roshan Ahmed Baig served as the
          Commander-in-Chief of the army of Emperor Ameer. He was martyred in
          battle, and his blessed shrine (mazar mubarak) remains in Fatehpur,
          India, where it continues to be a place of pilgrimage for many. His
          middle brother, Miyan Dorhay Ahmed Baig, was among the close courtiers
          of Emperor Akbar, participating in his inner gatherings. The youngest
          brother, Miyan Kaday Ahmed Baig, was a man of deep spiritual and
          ascetic nature. He spent 60 years of his life in the wilderness,
          detached from the world. He reached such a high spiritual rank that
          even years after his passing, he was known to appear in person at his
          home. He was one of the most renowned Sufis of the family and remained
          unmarried throughout his life. He dedicated his entire life to the
          commandments of Allah and His Messenger, and Allah honored him with
          such a spiritual station that whoever offers a vow (niaz) in his name
          for the fulfillment of a need, Allah fulfills that need. In the family
          tradition, his niaz is offered specifically on sweet "pedas" (a type
          of traditional sweet). In the later part of his life, he once said:
          “Anyone from my family who seeks my help, I will assist them in every
          matter.” Even today, Hazrat Miya Huzoor has said: “Whenever we face
          any difficulty, we offer the niaz of our noble elder, Miyan Kaday
          Ahmed Baig (may Allah’s mercy be upon him), on sweet pedas—and the
          problem is resolved.” Glad Tidings of Your Blessed Birth Before the
          blessed birth of Miya Huzoor, a saintly figure came to visit your
          grandfather. He told him, “You will be blessed with a son—name him
          Tariq.” The name of this noble saint was Baba Abdul Samad. At that
          time, he was the Qutb al-Aqtab (the highest spiritual pole of the
          age), and he had come to your grandfather’s home under the command of
          Khawaja Khawajgaan, Khawaja Moinuddin Chishti (RA) to deliver this
          divine message. Baba Abdul Samad was a close friend of Faiz Ahmed Baig
          (your father). When Miyan Huzoor was born, there was a prominent red
          mark on his forehead, which made his grandmother tie a cloth band over
          it to protect him from the evil eye. At the time of birth, Baba
          Abdus-Samad placed his blessed saliva into the mouth of the newborn,
          named him Tariq, and prayed: “A spiritual order (silsilah) will be
          established through him, and the world will benefit from his
          blessings.” He also gave a profound warning and left a will: “Keep
          this child away from the yogis. The mark on his forehead is very
          special—yogis will be seeking this child. They will surely come here
          looking for him. So either leave this place or relocate somewhere
          else.” After delivering this message, Baba Abdus-Samad departed—and
          was never seen again.

        <h3>An Incident from the Youth of Miyan Huzoor</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          When Miyan Huzoor entered his youth, he had a quiet and reserved
          nature. He had no close friends and remained focused on his own work.
          On one occasion, while at work, an interesting event took place: A
          colleague of Miyan Huzoor had fallen in love with a girl. In hopes of
          winning her affection, he visited a powerful spiritual practitioner
          (aamil) of that time, whose name was Seeta Raam. Seeta Raam was
          considered a master of esoteric sciences in his era. Seeta Raam told
          the man, “The young man who works with you—his name is Tariq—bring him
          to me, and I will make your work successful.” The man was quite
          surprised but agreed. Without telling Miyan Huzoor the full story, he
          brought him along. When Miyan Huzoor arrived, Seeta Raam looked at him
          and said, “Tariq, you’ve come—why did you take so long?” He then
          continued, “I see in you a great spiritual master and a powerful
          practitioner of the unseen sciences for this era.” Miyan Huzoor spent
          some time with Seeta Ram, during which he engaged in various spiritual
          retreats and esoteric practices, eventually gaining complete mastery
          over the science of Sankiyat (a rare and complex spiritual
          discipline). When Baba Seeta Raam met Mian Huzoor for the last time,
          he said: “Tariq, whatever I learned from my Gurus, I have passed on to
          you. I am now 90 years old, but in all my experience with spiritual
          practices (amaliyat), I have not come across anyone as accomplished as
          you.” Then he added, “Now listen to me carefully. Perhaps we may never
          meet again.” Saying this, Baba Seeta Raam took off a ring from his own
          hand and placed it on Mian Huzoor’s finger. He then made a will: “When
          this ring breaks, go and take bay‘ah (spiritual allegiance) at that
          place — that will be your true destination.” After that, Baba Seeta
          Raam departed, and they never met again. This incident clearly
          reflects the greatness and spiritual stature of Mian Huzoor — that
          even non-Muslims acknowledged his spirituality. The knowledge and
          practices that Baba Sita Ram had acquired over a lifetime of effort,
          he personally summoned Mian Huzoor and passed on to him directly. Mian
          Huzoor began learning such intense and demanding spiritual practices
          (amaliyat) from the age of 14, that merely hearing about them from his
          blessed lips would bring tears to one’s eyes. It would revive the
          memory of the struggles and disciplines of the saints of the past,
          awakening a deep yearning for remembrance (dhikr) and contemplation
          (fikr) in the heart.

        <h2>Mian Huzoor’s Journey on the Path of Sufism and Visiting Saints</h2>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Whenever Mian Huzoor would go to a saint in pursuit of the spiritual
          path (suluk), the spiritual states (maqamat) of that saint would be
          lifted or disrupted. The saint would then say to Mian Huzoor, “Your
          destination lies elsewhere.” For about a year, Mian Huzoor continued
          searching for his true spiritual guide and destination.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Mian Huzoor's Meeting with Dada Mian Khwaja Manzoor Hussain</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          After much effort, one day Mian Huzoor finally found his destined
          path. This event took place in 1979. At that time Someone told him, “A
          saint has come from the city of Mewat in India. He belongs to the
          Madariya Shattari lineage. He is very pious and reserved. Let’s go for
          his visitation.” Mian Huzoor declined and went home to sleep. That
          night, in a dream, he saw a saint calling him to come closer. He
          immediately sought out the person who had invited him and went to meet
          the saint — Dada Mian Hazrat Khwaja Manzoor Hussain Shah (may Allah
          have mercy on him). When Mian Huzoor reached him and looked at his own
          hand, he noticed that the ring was no longer on his finger.
          Distressed, he began searching for it. Dada Mian Khwaja Manzoor
          Hussain Shah said, “Have you lost something?” Mian Huzoor replied,
          “Yes, my ring is missing.” Dada Mian responded, “Your ring is with me
          — and it has broken into two pieces.” When Mian Huzoor looked at his
          hand, he saw that the ring was indeed in Dada Mian’s hand, broken into
          two parts. Right then and there, he bowed his head and said, “This is
          my destination.”

          Mian Huzoor Seeks Bay‘ah (Spiritual Allegiance) from Khwaja Manzoor
          Hussain
        </h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Mian Huzoor asked Syed Manzoor Hussain Shah Sahib, “Please accept me
          as your disciple.” Dada Mian replied, “We do not accept disciples so
          easily. First, go and perform the Fajr prayer after the Wudu
          (ablution) of Isha (night prayer) for forty (40) days. Then return to
          me.” Mian Huzoor left, intending to follow the instructions and return
          for the initiation (bay‘ah). Khwaja Manzoor Hussain Shah's Instruction

        <h3>The Forty-Day Recitation of Surah Al-Muzzammil</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          When Mian Huzoor returned after forty days and asked for the bay‘ah,
          Syed Manzoor Hussain Shah Sahib said, “Why the hurry? We have come
          here just for you. First, recite Surah Al-Muzzammil 360 times daily
          for forty days. Then come back to me.” Mian Huzoor complied and
          returned after completing the recitation. The Forty-Day Recitation of
          Surah Al-Ikhlas Next, Dada Mian instructed, “Go and recite Surah
          Al-Ikhlas 14,000 times daily for forty days. After that, come back.”
          When Mian Huzoor (Shah Arif Tariq Ahmad Qadri) completed these
          prescribed tasks as commanded, Dada Mian Khwaja Manzoor Hussain Shah
          initiated him in 1979, granting him spiritual authority (khilafah) and
          permission (ijazah). He guided Mian Huzoor through the stages of
          spiritual progress (suluk).

        <h3>Initiation and Spiritual Authority (Khilafah) After Bay‘ah</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Khwaja Manzoor Hussain (may Allah have mercy on him) granted Mian
          Huzoor the spiritual authority (khilafah) and permission (ijazah) of
          the Madariya family. He imparted to him all the special practices
          (dhikr and azkar) and spiritual exercises (ashghal) of the Madariya
          family and taught him the specific spiritual stations (manazil) of the
          Madariya path. Mian Huzoor spent only a short period of time with Dada
          Mian Khwaja Manzoor Hussain Shah (may Allah have mercy on him). When
          Dada Mian was about to travel to India, he entrusted Mian Huzoor to
          the care of Hazrat Irfan Ali Shah, saying, “Mian Irfan, take care of
          him as we have cared for you.” Khwaja Irfan Ali Shah was not only a
          special disciple (mureed khas) and spiritual successor (khaleefah) of
          Khwaja Manzoor Hussain Shah, but also a childhood friend. When Dada
          Mian entrusted Mian Huzoor to Hazrat Irfan Ali Shah, the remaining
          education and spiritual training of Mian Huzoor was provided by him.
          Hazrat Irfan Ali Shah also granted Mian Huzoor the spiritual authority
          and permission of his own family and taught him the Madariya family’s
          practices, the sacred dhikr and azkar, and imparted knowledge of the
          spiritual lineage (shajarah).

        <h3>The Ancestral Lineage of Irfan Ali Shah Sahib</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The father of Irfan Ali Shah was Mir Muzaffar Hussain Shah, and his
          grandfather was Hazrat Shah Latifullah. His great-grandfather was Shah
          Fazal Ganj Muradabadi.

        <h3>The Daily Practices (Wazaif) of Irfan Ali Shah Sahib</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Irfan Ali Shah Sahib spent 14 years in spiritual devotion (riyada) at
          the shrine of Mian Mir. He was a great practitioner of Surah Al-Ikhlas
          and a distinguished saint. His daily routine involved reciting Surah
          Al-Ikhlas 14,000 times, a practice he maintained for almost 40 years.
          Mian Huzoor was granted permission by Pir Irfan Ali Shah to recite
          Surah Al-Ikhlas. Pir Irfan Ali Shah had deep love and affection for
          Mian Huzoor and showed great kindness towards him. He completed Mian
          Huzoor's spiritual training.

        <h3>Mian Huzoor's Unique Spiritual Journey</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Mian Huzoor is a rare spiritual figure in whose case the request for
          initiation (bay‘ah talab) came first, followed by the sincere
          spiritual commitment (bay‘ah iradat). Very few saints have had their
          initiation requested before they actually committed to it.

        <p>
          After the passing of Sufi Khwaja Irfan Ali Shah (may Allah have mercy
          on him), whose blessed shrine is in Faisalabad, Mian Huzoor became
          restless, feeling a deep urge to seek the company of another spiritual
          master to continue his journey. He desired to meet and be in the
          company of another great saint.

        <h3>The Meeting with Hazrat Khwaja Osman Ali Shah in 1981</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Some time later, in 1981, Mian Huzoor had the opportunity to meet
          Hazrat Khwaja Osman Ali Shah (may Allah have mercy on him), a revered
          saint from the Qadri, Soharwardi, and Chishti families. The event
          unfolded as follows: One day, Mian Huzoor (Shaykh Tariq Ahmad Shah
          Arif) was deeply engrossed in dhikr (remembrance of Allah) in his
          private room (hujra). His father-in-law knocked on the door and said,
          “Mian, how long will you stay locked in your room? Come, I will take
          you to meet a great saint.” Mian Huzoor replied, “I do not wish to
          meet anyone anymore.” Saying this, Mian Huzoor returned to his room.
          That night, Mian Huzoor had a dream in which he saw a great saint
          giving him something and also saw his father-in-law. The next day,
          Mian Huzoor spoke to his father-in-law and said, “You mentioned a
          saint yesterday, and I saw him in my dream last night.” His
          father-in-law replied, “Never mind, I am not going now.”
        </p>

        <h3>
          Mian Huzoor's Initiation from Hazrat Khwaja Osman Ali Shah Hassani
          (may Allah have mercy on him)
        </h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Mian Huzoor said, “Let me also visit him.” His father-in-law replied,
          “Yesterday you refused, and today you want to go. What has happened?
          Is everything alright?” Mian Huzoor responded, “Everything is fine;
          just come, and let us go.” His father-in-law agreed, and they went to
          meet the saint. When Mian Huzoor arrived at the place, he was
          astonished—it was the same place he had seen in his dream the previous
          night. His longing for the visit grew stronger, and the waiting time
          seemed to stretch out like centuries. It was mid-day when Mian Huzoor
          reached the place, and as he approached, he saw a saint sitting by the
          door as if waiting for someone. The saint, upon seeing Mian Huzoor,
          immediately said, “I have been waiting for you. Tell me, Mian Tariq,
          are you in a state of wudu (ablution)?” Mian Huzoor replied, “Yes, I
          always remain in wudu.” The saint smiled and said, “I am the one whom
          you saw in your dream last night. Now, your share is here.” Hazrat
          Khwaja Osman Ali Shah Hassani (may Allah have mercy on him) had
          already prepared two cups of tea. He drank half of one cup and then
          offered the rest to Mian Huzoor, officially initiating him into the
          spiritual path (bay‘ah) Mian Huzoor's Permission and Spiritual
          Authority (Khilafah) from Hazrat Khwaja Osman Ali Shah Hassani (may
          Allah have mercy on him) There, Hazrat Dada Mian Osman Ali Shah
          granted Mian Huzoor the initiation (bay‘ah) and said, “We have taken
          your sincere bay‘ah, and the bay‘ah you previously had was one of
          request (bay‘ah talab). Our lineage is Qadri, Soharwardi, Chishti, and
          Qalandari, but we are now connected to the lineage of Abul Alai.” He
          continued, “Now, you may go, but remember that we hold a gathering on
          the 17th of the lunar month. Be sure to attend it.” After receiving
          the initiation, Mian Huzoor left.

        <p>
          After the initiation, in obedience to the command of his spiritual
          master, Mian Huzoor went to attend the gathering on the 17th of the
          lunar month, when the special gathering at Hazrat Dada Mian’s place
          was in full swing. At the time, Mian Huzoor’s financial situation was
          not very favorable, but in obedience to his master’s order, he
          responded to the call and traveled on foot from New Karachi to Malir
          to attend the gathering.

          When Mian Huzoor attended the 17th of the lunar month gathering with
          his spiritual master, Hazrat Dada Mian Osman Ali Shah (may Allah have
          mercy on him), he bestowed upon him all the spiritual permissions and
          authorities (ijazah and khilafah) that he had received from his own
          elders. He then instructed Mian Huzoor, saying, "Now go and continue
          the work you used to do." At that time, Mian Huzoor was deeply engaged
          in dhikr (remembrance of Allah). After completing his dhikr, Mian
          Huzoor asked, "O Master, what is the next command for me?" In
          response, Hazrat Dada Mian pointed to a brother-in-faith(Peer bhai)
          named Suleman and said, "He has a great passion for spiritual
          practices (ilm al-‘amal). Make him perform spiritual work (amaliyat)

        <p>
          It was as if, with the granting of permission and khilafah, Hazrat
          Dada Mian had chosen Mian Huzoor to train other disciples as well.
          With the permission of his spiritual master, Mian Huzoor instructed
          his fellow disciple, Suleman Sahib, to perform the spiritual practice
          (amal) of Surah Ikhlas for just 21 days. After completing the
          practice, Suleman Sahib presented the results to Mian Huzoor. When
          Hazrat Dada Mian saw this, he said, to Mian Huzoor “We had instructed
          you to make him perform some spiritual practice(amaliyat), but you
          have made him perfectly complete it in just 3 weeks!”
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>An Important Advice</h3>
        <p>
          Hazrat Dada Mian advised Suleman Sahib, saying: “Never misuse this
          spiritual practice. Use it only for the sake of your spiritual order
          (silsilah).” This advice was not only for him, but something we should
          also take to heart. Mian Huzoor often repeated this guidance: that our
          dhikr, spiritual practices, seclusions, worship, and efforts—whether
          religious, social, or charitable—should not be for personal gain.
          Rather, they should be for the pleasure of Allah, service to humanity,
          and the propagation and strengthening of the spiritual path. If we
          succeed in following this advice, success in both worlds will be our
          destiny. May Allah grant us the ability to act upon this. Ameen.

          The Special Connection of the Monthly 17th Night Gathering with
          Ghaus-e-Pak
        </h3>
        <p>
          Dada Usman Mian had a special affection for Mian Huzoor. The reason,
          he would often say, was that Sheikh Abdul Qadir
          Jilani—Ghaus-e-Pak—keeps the strongest spiritual gaze and attention on
          Tariq. Once, Dada Mian asked, “Tariq, whose niyaz (commemorative
          offering) do you observe?” Mian Huzoor replied, “I observe the niyaz
          of Hazrat Shah Madar (رحمۃ اللہ علیہ) on the 17th of the month.” Dada
          Usman Mian then instructed, “From today, you will observe the 17th for
          Ghaus-e-Pak. I give you permission for this.” This event took place in
          1982. Mian Huzoor says, “From that day till now, I have continuously
          observed the 17th night in honor of Ghaus-e-Pak.”
        </p>
        <h3>Mian Huzoor's Practice of the Chehl Kaaf</h3>
        <p>
          When Mian Huzoor was granted the 17th (special connection to
          Ghaus-e-Pak), Dada Mian instructed him, “Now begin the practice of
          Chehl Kaaf.” Mian Huzoor immediately began the Chehl Kaaf practice.
          During this spiritual journey, he experienced countless divine visions
          and spiritual unveilings, the details of which have been shared Mian
          Huzoor in his various videos on youtube Channel Ruhani Jawahir. (It is
          advised to watch the videos of Mian Huzoor on Ruhani Jawahir where he
          has shared many of his personal experiences and gave valuable
          teachings, tarbiyati nashisht for a seeker the value of which is
          priceless & also to purchase the books of Malfuzat, jawahir ul
          Amileen, Arbaeen E Tariqi and many more for further spiritual
          insights)
        </p>
        <h3>The Beginning of Mian Huzoor’s (Al-Anam Yunani) Dispensary.</h3>
        <p>
          Mian Huzoor had only limited physical interaction with Dada Mian Usman
          Ali Shah Hasni (may Allah have mercy on him). Whenever Dada Mian would
          call for him, Mian Huzoor would go, and they would spend a short time
          discussing the teachings and practices of the spiritual path
          (silsila). After some time, Dada Mian instructed him, “Now only come
          to me on Fridays, not on any other day.” Mian Huzoor, honoring his
          beloved Murshid’s directive, began visiting only on Fridays. This
          continued for some time. One day, Dada Mian asked Mian Huzoor, “Do you
          know Hikmat (Unani medicine)?” Mian Huzoor replied, “Yes, I do.” Dada
          Mian said, “Then why don’t you open a dispensary? From today, open a
          dawakhana (clinic) and serve people. Benefit them as much as
          possible.” This occurred around the year 1985. Thus, Mian Huzoor laid
          the foundation of his clinic and named it Al-Anam Yunani Dawakhana.
          Mian Huzoor began his Silsila work in 1979, and by the grace of Allah,
          that mission continues to thrive. He has fully devoted himself to the
          service of the spiritual path.

        <h3>A Precious Lesson for Disciples from This Incident</h3>
        <p>
          Let it be remembered that the stories of the saints are not meant to
          be listened to as mere tales—but to draw lessons from and act upon.
          From the incident of the relocation of Mian Huzoor's dispensary, we
          learn a profound truth: When a spiritual guide (Peer) gives an
          instruction, it is the duty of a sincere disciple to set aside their
          own will, to look beyond worldly means and logic, and to act upon that
          command without hesitation. In doing so, the disciple will receive
          blessings and benefits far greater than they could ever imagine—just
          as Mian Huzoor did by obeying the command of his revered Murshid. May
          Allah, through the blessings of the dust beneath Mian Huzoor's feet,
          grant us the ability to follow in his footsteps and live according to
          the teachings of the path. The truth is this: Whoever detaches from
          the world, the world humbles itself before them; but whoever chases
          the world, they are humiliated by it. Spiritual Practices and Daily
          Devotions of Hazrat Khwaja Usman Ali Shah – May Allah's Mercy Be Upon
          Him Murshid Pak, Khwaja Sufi Hakim Tariq Ahmed Qadri, states that
          Hazrat Khwaja Sufi Syed Usman Ali Shah – may Allah's mercy be upon him
          – performed three major spiritual retreats (chillas): • The first
          chilla was of Bismillah Sharif, • The second was of Surah Ikhlas, and
          • The third was of Chehl Kaaf Sharif. He maintained these three
          practices consistently throughout his life. In addition to these, he
          also engaged in Moula Hussain Ki Choki and was an adept practitioner
          of Nad-e-Ali Sharif. He would teach the daily litanies (awraad and
          wazaif) of the spiritual order to his disciples, emphasizing
          steadfastness (istiqamat) in practice. From the spiritual retreats he
          personally performed, he would selectively teach chillas to deserving
          seekers. Hazrat Dada Usman Mian (may Allah's mercy be upon him) was
          deeply immersed in remembrance (dhikr) and remained abundantly engaged
          in it throughout his life. Teachings of Hazrat Khwaja Usman Ali Shah –
          May Allah's Mercy Be Upon Him Steadfastness in Times of Hardship He
          would often emphasize the importance of steadfastness (istiqamat).
          Regarding difficulties and trials, he used to say: "On the path of
          spiritual journey (suluk), the hardships that arise must be endured.
          While it's true that one may find relief after a trial, true spiritual
          progress comes through enduring those trials." He further advised: "Do
          not seek to escape these hardships, because although avoiding them may
          bring temporary relief, the same trials often return. Therefore, pass
          through these difficulties — doing so reduces future burdens and
          strengthens you on the path." His teachings served as a reminder that
          trials are not obstacles, but stepping stones toward spiritual
          elevation. Faqr (Spiritual Poverty-detachment from worldly possesions)
          and Yaqeen (Certainty) — Teachings of Hazrat Khwaja Usman Ali Shah –
          May Allah's Mercy Be Upon Him He used to say: “Every person’s destiny
          is written on their forehead like a seal. And just like a seal appears
          reversed at first glance but prints correctly when pressed on paper—so
          too, when one falls in prostration (sajdah), their destiny becomes
          upright. It is through sajdah that destiny becomes aligned.” He
          emphasized deep trust in Allah, saying: “One must have such certainty
          in the Divine that even if there isn’t a single coin in your pocket,
          still your heart should be convinced that ‘My Lord is the Owner of me
          and the entire universe—so the entire universe is mine.’ Because my
          Lord created the universe for me, it is all for me. And I belong
          entirely to my Lord.” He continued: “So, I have no need to bow before
          creation—I must only bow before the Lord of all. And when I bow before
          my Lord, the universe will bow before me. For everything lower is
          commanded to prostrate before what is higher—and none is higher than
          my Lord. Therefore, I am only to prostrate before Him. And when I do
          so, I become a manifestation of Truth (mazhar-e-Haqq). And whoever
          becomes a manifestation of Truth, the entire universe is made
          subservient to them.”

        <h3>Attachment and Inclination Toward the Murshid</h3>
        <p>
          He showed respect to all elders, but his deep love and attachment were
          reserved solely for his own spiritual guide (Murshid). Murshid Paak
          Khwaja Tariq Ahmed (may his blessings endure) states that due to his
          immense love for his Murshid (Khwaja Muhammad Hasan Shah sarkar)
          —greater than for himself—he would rarely visit other spiritual
          centers or shrines.

          Meetings with Saints and Permissions for Wazaaif and Practices –
          Hazrat Khwaja Usman Ali Shah Hasani (May Allah's Mercy Be Upon Him)
        </h3>
        <p>
          At the time when he (may Allah's mercy be upon him) received Khilafat
          (spiritual succession) and permission, Hazrat Shah Inayat Hussain (may
          Allah's mercy be upon him) was still alive. So, he went to visit him
          as well—accompanied by his spiritual guide, Hazrat Khwaja Hasan Mian
          (may Allah's mercy be upon him). Once, when Hazrat Usman Mian (may
          Allah's mercy be upon him) traveled with Hazrat Hasan Mian (may
          Allah's mercy be upon him) to Hyderabad Deccan for a visit, they went
          to the shrine of Hazrat Banda Nawaz Gaisu Daraaz (may Allah's mercy be
          upon him), who was the Sajjada Nashin (hereditary custodian) there.
          Hazrat Hasan Mian had been invited by him. There, one of the disciples
          of Hazrat Banda Nawaz was Maulana Abdul Qadeer, who was the Vice
          Chancellor of Islamia University in Deccan. He was deeply inspired by
          Hazrat Hasan Mian and developed a close friendship with Hazrat Usman
          Mian (may Allah's mercy be upon him). With permission from Hazrat
          Hasan Mian, Maulana Abdul Qadeer guided Hazrat Usman Mian through the
          Chilla (spiritual retreat) of Hizb al-Bahr, which was completed in
          three days at the same learning center associated with Hazrat Gaisu
          Daraaz (may Allah's mercy be upon him). In addition to Hizb al-Bahr,
          Hazrat Usman Mian (may Allah's mercy be upon him) was also granted
          permission to carry out the awraad and wazaaif (spiritual practices)
          of his family lineage.

        <h3>
          His Meeting with Khwaja Hasan Nizami (May Allah's Mercy Be Upon Him)
        </h3>
        <p>
          Hazrat Usman Mian (may Allah's mercy be upon him) spent some time in
          Delhi, during which he met Khwaja Hasan Nizami (may Allah's mercy be
          upon him). After meeting him, Khwaja Hasan Nizami was deeply impressed
          by him, and a strong bond of love and affection developed between
          them. Khwaja Hasan Nizami then invited Hazrat Usman Mian to stay at
          his home, and he accepted the invitation. During his stay, Khwaja
          Hasan Nizami (may Allah's mercy be upon him) guided him through a
          three-day chilla (spiritual retreat) of Hizb al-Bahr at his own
          residence and also granted him permission for the Du'a-e-Khaas
          (Special Supplication). It is through Khwaja Hasan Nizami (may Allah's
          mercy be upon him) that the permission for Du'a-e-Khaas was formally
          passed on within India, and he personally taught Hazrat Usman Mian the
          complete method and etiquette of this special prayer.

        <h3>
          His Meeting with Shah Jamal Kambalposh (May Allah’s Mercy Be Upon Him)
        </h3>
        <p>
          During his time in Delhi, Hazrat Usman Mian (may Allah’s mercy be upon
          him) also met Shah Jamal Kambalposh (may Allah’s mercy be upon him),
          who is buried near the shrine of Sheikh Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya (may
          Allah’s mercy be upon him). There had been significant legal and
          personal disputes between Shah Jamal Kambalposh and Khwaja Hasan
          Nizami. Shah Jamal Kambalposh was also a renowned practitioner (amil)
          of Hizb al-Bahr in India. He granted Hazrat Usman Mian the
          authorization (ijazah) for Hizb al-Bahr as well as for the
          Awrad-e-Nizamiya (spiritual litanies of the Nizami order).
          Furthermore, he gave him permission to adopt the Kambal (blanket)
          tradition, meaning Hazrat Usman Mian was allowed to wear the symbolic
          blanket and be recognized as a Kambalposh (cloak-wearing dervish),
          should he choose to do so. Additionally, Shah Jamal Kambalposh (may
          Allah’s mercy be upon him) also granted him ijazah for Surah
          Al-Muzzammil, adding to the spiritual treasures bestowed upon Hazrat
          Usman Mian. His Return from Delhi Hazrat Usman Mian (may Allah's mercy
          be upon him) shared with his mureed, Hazrat Khwaja Tariq Ahmad Qadri
          (may Allah’s mercy be upon him), the stories of his encounters and the
          various spiritual authorizations (ijazah) he received. He mentioned
          that during his time in Delhi, he had the privilege of meeting many
          esteemed elders. Hazrat Khwaja Tariq Ahmad Qadri (may Allah’s mercy be
          upon him) recalls that Hazrat Usman Mian (may Allah's mercy be upon
          him) would often say that since Hazrat Hassan Mian (may Allah's mercy
          be upon him) granted him the spiritual lineage (Shajarah) and taught
          him the specific litanies (Awrad), he had never abandoned them. These
          practices became an integral part of his daily routine, and Hazrat
          Usman Mian (may Allah’s mercy be upon him) remained steadfast in
          following the spiritual exercises taught by Hazrat Dada Hassan Mian
          (may Allah's mercy be upon him).
        </p>
        <h3>The Love and Affection of His Spiritual Master for Usman Mian</h3>
        <p>
          Khwaja Sufi Tariq Ahmad Shah states that Hazrat Hassan Mian (may
          Allah’s mercy be upon him) had immense love for Usman Mian (may
          Allah’s mercy be upon him). So much so that when it came to his
          disciples—he would say to Usman Mian, “You will be responsible for
          their spiritual training.” He would further instruct, “As you train
          them, send me their names.” Usman Mian (may Allah’s mercy be upon him)
          undertook the spiritual training of seven or eight of his fellow
          disciples (peer-brothers). Through Hazrat Hassan Mian’s approval, he
          also granted spiritual authorization and succession (Ijazah and
          Khilafah) to those peer-brothers. Usman Mian (may Allah’s mercy be
          upon him) would say, “Whatever my spiritual master taught me, I never
          kept hidden from my peer-brothers.” Among his special and intimate
          spiritual practices (Awrad), he maintained deep devotion and
          discipline in the recitation of Surah Al-Ikhlas with Divine Names and
          Chehl Kaaf was in his one of the very special recitations. Not Doing
          Anything Without the Permission of the Murshid Hazrat Usman Mian (may
          Allah's mercy be upon him) used to say that the chilla (spiritual
          retreat) which Khwaja Hasan Nizami (may Allah’s mercy be upon him)
          made him do, he only practiced it once and that too with the
          permission of his Murshid. Any spiritual practices, awraad o wazaif
          (daily recitations), or chillas that were taught to him by other
          saints, he would always seek permission from his own Pir, Hazrat Hasan
          Mian (may Allah’s mercy be upon him), before practicing them. He used
          to say, “Whatever spiritual practices or recitations I received from
          other elders, I practiced only after obtaining my Murshid’s
          permission.”

        <h3>
          The Last Meeting of Tariq Ahmad Shah Sahib (May Allah preserve him)
          with His Murshid Hazrat Khwaja Sufi Tariq Ahmad Shah Arif (may Allah
          preserve him) states:
        </h3>
        <p>
          "In the final days of Hazrat Usman Mian (may Allah’s mercy be upon
          him), I met him for around 40 minutes. During this meeting, he said to
          me, ‘Whatever spiritual secrets I had, and whatever I received from my
          Murshid, I have now entrusted all of it to you. The responsibility of
          this spiritual path (silsila) is now upon your shoulders. All the
          spiritual orders (silsilas) that I had kept hidden until now—I have
          shared them with you. The recitations (azkar) and practices (asbaaq)
          have all been explained and passed on to you. Now it is in your
          hands.’ At this, I humbly submitted, ‘Mian, I will do my best to carry
          the lineage forward, but I don’t have the means. I don’t get much free
          time because of my daily work—I manage two shifts at the clinic and
          handle my household responsibilities, and only then do I find time to
          complete the spiritual lessons you’ve given me.’ Upon hearing this,
          Hazrat Usman Mian (may Allah’s mercy be upon him) replied, ‘You don’t
          need to do anything. The work will be done through you. How it will
          happen, that is not your concern—it’s His (Allah’s) decision. And
          remember, you are in need, you are weak. But your Lord is neither in
          need nor weak. I am not giving all this from my own will—if it were
          about my will, I would have given it to my own children. But here,
          will has no place. Now go—I entrust you to Allah. May Allah be your
          Protector and Helper.’”

        <h3>
          Miracles of Usman Mian (May Allah’s Mercy Be Upon Him) The Door
          Opening on Its Own
        </h3>
        <p>
          Among the disciples (murideen) of Usman Mian (may Allah’s mercy be
          upon him), only four individuals were granted permission to enter his
          private chamber (Hujra Khaas). Their names were Ghulam Haider, Jalal
          Ahmad, Nasir Mian, and Afzal Mian.
        </p>
        <h3>Afzal Mian narrates:</h3>
        <p>
          Whenever Usman Mian (may Allah’s mercy be upon him) needed something
          and would call out to one of us, the door of his private chamber would
          open on its own. And when we entered, it would automatically close
          behind us. There was no need for anyone to manually open or shut the
          door. He would remain seated in his place the entire time.
        </p>
        <h3>The Body Splitting into Parts</h3>
        <p>
          Afzal Mian narrates (this incident occurred in 1997): Some people had
          come to visit Usman Mian (may Allah’s mercy be upon him) from Sanghar
          and other places. I went to knock on the door, but there was no
          response from inside. So, I opened the door myself, and as soon as I
          entered, I was shocked to see that the blessed body of Usman Mian was
          split into four parts. Panicked, I rushed outside and told my fellow
          disciple, “It seems like Mian Sahab has been martyred!” Nasir Mian
          scolded me, saying, “What are you saying?” I explained what I had seen
          inside. He replied, “We’ve all been sitting out here—no one went
          inside. How could anyone have done that?” Afzal Mian said, “Then come
          and see for yourself.” But Nasir Mian responded, “No, just sit here
          for now.” A little while later, Sayyid Usman Ali Shah (may Allah’s
          mercy be upon him) called from inside, “Afzal Mian, come in.” When I
          entered again, he was calmly seated on his charpai (cot), and he said
          with a gentle smile, “Why were you so frightened? And don’t tell
          anyone about this incident.”
        </p>
        <h3>Usman Mian's Spiritual Unveiling (Kashf)</h3>
        <p>
          His khalifa, Afzal Mian, narrates that Usman Mian (may Allah’s mercy
          be upon him) possessed such deep spiritual unveiling (kashf) and
          miraculous insight (karamat) that no matter where we were or what we
          were discussing, he would repeat our words back to us exactly, word
          for word. He would say, “Here you spoke correctly, and here you were
          wrong.” If Afzal Mian ever praised Usman Mian somewhere, he would be
          corrected, “The praise you gave about me in that place was incorrect.
          Do not praise me.” He was always aware of our conditions and inner
          states. And if he ever needed to call us while we were in another city
          or region, we would hear his voice so clearly in our ear, it would
          feel as though he was physically standing in front of us, speaking
          directly.
        </p>
        <h3>Prediction of an Incident Before It Happened</h3>
        <p>
          Afzal Mian narrates: Once, in September 1987, I had to travel to a
          place for some work. When I sought permission to go from Usman Mian
          (may Allah’s mercy be upon him), he told me, “Do not go to there on
          that date.” I replied, “Hazrat, my booking has already been made.” He
          said, “Cancel it.” So, I went ahead and cancelled my booking.
          Coincidentally, on that very date, the Express train met with a
          terrible accident. The entire coach number 22, in which I was booked,
          was completely destroyed — all the passengers in that compartment
          passed away. Not a single soul survived. Usman Mian (may Allah’s mercy
          be upon him) would often foretell things like this. He would say,
          “Tomorrow you're going to such-and-such place,” even before any travel
          arrangements were made — and somehow, the circumstances would arise,
          and I’d end up going.

        <h3>The Wish of Disciples Fulfilled by the Arrival of a Qawwal</h3>
        <p>
          Afzal Mian narrates: Once, on the 17th of the month, a Fatiha
          gathering was held, and some guests had arrived to attend. After the
          Fatiha, the guests requested Usman Mian (may Allah have mercy on him),
          “Mian Sahib, please arrange for us to hear a Qawwali.” Usman Mian
          replied, “Afzal Mian, go sit by the gate, and whoever passes by, bring
          him inside.” So I went and sat at the gate. After a little while, a
          man approached and asked, “Where is Usman Mian’s house?” I replied,
          “This is the place.” He said, “We are Qawwals and had come here to
          perform at another gathering. We’ll be leaving in the morning, so we
          thought we should also perform at Usman Mian’s place.” Afzal Mian says
          he was stunned — Mian Sahib had simply said, “Bring in whoever passes
          by” — and the very first person who passed was a Qawwal! This is just
          one among countless karamat (miraculous events) and kashf (spiritual
          unveilings) associated with his blessed life.

        <h3>Closing Note</h3>
        <p>
          Hakim Sufi Shaykh Tariq Ahmad Shah Arif (مدظلہ العالی) stands as a
          beacon of profound spiritual insight, possessing numerous spiritual
          chains and khaas ijazats in various amaal, zikr and azkaar. These
          sacred blessings reflect his deep connection with the divine and his
          unmatched role as a guide in Tariqat. His spiritual rank is such that
          no single book, nor even a volume, could ever do justice to the
          immense depth, magnificence, and honor he embodies. His presence among
          us is a rare gift, a divine favor that we must cherish and seek to
          learn from, with full khuloos (sincerity) and istiqamat
          (steadfastness) on the path of Tariqat. We are blessed to be in the
          company of such a revered Wali-e-Kamil, whose teachings extend far
          beyond words, inspiring us to elevate our lives and hearts in the
          service of Allah Ta'ala. May we remain humble, seeking Allah’s
          guidance in every step, and remain unwavering in our commitment to the
          sacred teachings of Mian Huzoor. Let us continue to work with
          sincerity for the Silsila, ensuring its legacy of divine light and
          knowledge continues to illuminate the hearts of all seekers. May Allah
          Ta'ala bless us with His guidance, grant us the ability to walk the
          path with true devotion, and enable us to serve this noble lineage
          with loyalty and love. Ameen.
